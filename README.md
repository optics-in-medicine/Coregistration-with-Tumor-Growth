# Coregistration-with-Tumor-Growth
The same existing coregistration code with the added element of enlarging the tumor in the H&E image to compensate for tumor shrinking that occurs during fixation. 

The code enlarges the tumor by 5% currently, but this can be altered by changing the value of "growth" in grow_tumor.
